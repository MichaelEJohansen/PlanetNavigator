# PlanetNavigator
Project that aims to simulate a 'ship' in 2D space with the effects of gravity (from a planet) and thrust to work with. Made with the intention of developing an AI to learn how to put itself in orbit around 'planets'.

## Controls
- Up Arrow: Increase thrust.
- Down Arrow: Decrease thrust.
- Left Arrow: Rotate thrust vector counter-clockwise.
- Right Arrow: Rotate thrust vector clockwise.
- Space Bar: Engage thrust.
- Left Control: Reset the ship.

## UI
- Blue Bar: Vector describing the current force of gravity on the ship.
- Green/ Red Bar: Vector describing the current value and direction of thrust. Green means that the ship is not currently thrusting, red means that the ship is thrusting.
- Black Bar: Vector describing the current direction and magnitude of the ship's velocity.
